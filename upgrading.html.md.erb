<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to upgrade <%= vars.product_full %> (PCF).

Configured properties from your existing tile are brought into the new installation.
However, Pivotal recommends that you review your Scan, Errand, and Resource settings
before applying changes.

If you have a version of <%= vars.product_short %> currently installed
and want to upgrade to a later version:

1. Download the new version of the product file from Pivotal Network.
1. Follow the procedures found in [Installing and Configuring Compliance Scanner for PCF](./installing.html).
1. After applying changes to the Compliance Scanner for PCF tile, **Apply Changes** again for all tiles.<br>
  This is so that the version of Compliance Scanner for PCF on the VMs matches
  the version being used by the scanner.
