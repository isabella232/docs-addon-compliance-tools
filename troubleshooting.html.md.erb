           2019/07/05 21:11:05 Starting scan on 10.0.8.6
           2019/07/05 21:11:05 Get https://10.0.8.6:28893/run: x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid<br>
           Received no scan results

Stderr     -

Exit code 1

#### Explanation
Your certificates have expired.

#### Solution
Rotate your certificates. For instructions, see
[Rotating Certificates](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html).

### <a id='scan-exitcode-124'></a> scan_results Received Signal Terminated (Exit Code 124)

#### Symptom
Running a scan results in an `exit code 124` error similar to the following:

<pre class="terminal">
...
Instance   oscap_store/43aba653-4d0a-4cfc-bc72-a136ce33e3e0
Exit Code  124
Stdout    2019/06/24 15:43:30 Starting store on port 38894
          2019/06/24 15:43:30 [10.0.8.5] &lt;nil&gt;<br>
          2019/06/24 15:43:30 Starting scan on 10.0.8.5
          2019/06/24 15:43:31 Received signal terminated
</pre>

#### Explanation
Your scan has reached the configured timeout period.
This may occur if a VM lacks sufficient memory or CPU to finish its scan in time.

#### Solution

Do one of the following:

* Increase the scan timeout for all VMs. For more information, see
**Scanner Timeout** under [Configure Scans](./installing.html#scan).

* Increase the memory or CPU resources for any failing scanned VMs.

### <a id='scan-vm-noresults'></a> scan_results Does Not Include Scans for VMs in the Deployment

#### Symptom
Only scan results for the `oscap_store` VM are being generated.
VMs in the deployment are not being scanned.

#### Explanation
<%= vars.product_short %> is a BOSH add-on, as well as a tile.
When a scan is run, the `oscap_store` VM verifies each VM's OSCAP release version.
Because of this, the latest OSCAP release must be deployed on all VMs to function properly.

#### Solution
When installing or upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>, you must **Apply Changes**
on PAS (and any other tiles with VMs you want to scan) after applying changes
to the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.
This is so that the version of <%= vars.product_short %> on the VMs match the version
being used by the scanner.
