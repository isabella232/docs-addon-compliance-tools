<p class="note warning">
<strong>WARNING! </strong>
The <%= vars.product_full %> tile is currently in beta and is intended for evaluation and test purposes only. 
However, this product can be used in a PCF production environment, as it does not have any impact on other tiles or VMs.
</p>


This topic provides answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for <%= vars.product_full %>.

## <a id='faq-look'></a>How to Look at Tests on VMs
For every configuration rule that was checked,
there is a corresponding test written in yml test files residing on each Virtual Machine (VM).
It may be useful to use them as reference for internal test development,
or validate that the test matches the description.
To do this, do the following:

	1. Bosh ssh into a component vm
	1. Navigate to /var/vcap/packages/oscap/xfiles


## <a id='faq-write'></a>Is there a Way to Write Own Test
No. The beta release of <%= vars.product_short %> does not feature the ability to write your own tests.
The focus is not on the onboarding of writing YML tests,
or on using XGen to convert them to the SCAP format.


## <a id='faq-oscap-vm'></a>Is the oscap_store VM  Scanned
Yes. The `oscap_store` VM that this tile instantiates does get scanned.


## <a id='faq-number-of-logs'></a>How Many Scan Result Log Files Exist at a Time
On each VM, there resides only 1 log file per format at a time.
Subsequent scan would overwrite them.
The errand that retrieves each VMsâ€™ log file as a zip file also keeps a single copy only.
Subsequent retrieve errands will overwrite the zip file.
Clicking download while on the status tab will download the zip file to Ops Manager,
moving it to the Logs tab, with the file having a timestamp of when download was clicked.
Clicking download multiple times will create many zip files in Ops Manager, with different timestamps.


## <a id='faq-redeploy'></a>Does it Re-Deploy the Test Each Time Apply Changes is Clicked?
When apply changes is clicked and the PAS tile is checked,
the tile does not re-deploy its packaged contents.
Therefore, if there are no pending changes from other sources,
unchecking the PAS tile is recommended.
However, the scan errand on each VM will re-generate the SCAP tests each time,
by running XGen on XFiles.

## <a id='faq-default-off'></a>Why is the Scan Errand Off by Default? 
This is due to a timing issue.
For example, if an **Apply Changes** command has 4 items to install in addition to our tile,
those 4 items will not have the scanner deployed on them.
This is the case even if the Compliance Scanner tile is installed at the very end.
The Compliance Scanner tile is only aware of other tiles that are already present during its own deployment time.
The errand is set to `Off` by default to reduce the risk by Operators who believe that tiles which are part of the same deployment as Compliance Scanner are scanned.
