<p class="note warning">
<strong>WARNING! </strong>
The <%= vars.product_full %> tile is currently in beta and is intended for evaluation and test purposes only. 
However, this product can be used in a PCF production environment, as it does not have any impact on other tiles or VMs.
</p>


This topic describes how to install and configure <%= vars.product_full %>.


## <a id='install'></a> Install and Configure <%= vars.product_short %>
To install the <%= vars.product_short %> file on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, do the following:

1. Download the product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/compliance/).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file. 

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to the version number of <%= vars.product_short %>. 
This adds the tile to your staging area.

1. Click the newly added **<%= vars.product_short %>** tile.

**INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE**


## <a id='scan'></a> Configure Scans
This section is where you can select which set of benchmarks to run, and the expected value associated with various components for their corresponding tests.

1. Click the **Settings** tab.

1. Click **Scan configuration**.

	**INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE**

1. Select from the Output Formats (minimum 1 selection required):
  * The output of a scan can be in either log, xml or html formats.
  * A report will be generated for every Linux VM, benchmark, and log format selected.

1. Select which benchmarks you would like the scanner to run:
<table class="nice">
    <th>Benchmark</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <tr><td><strong>STIG for Ubuntu Xenial</strong></td>
            <td>This benchmark includes all the configuration tests of the published DISA STIG for Ubuntu 16.04, amended with Stemcell specific changes. Contains tests that would fail due to architectural differences.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Base-Xenial</strong></td>
            <td>Includes a subset of the amended tests in the STIG benchmark, where failing tests due to architectural differences are removed. This is meant to be used as a measure to see if configurations have been altered. *The Diego cell VM includes failing tests due to it's architecture.</td>
    </tr>
	<tr><td><strong>P1</strong></td>
            <td>A benchmark with rules that all systems should implement, regardless of user environment or sensitivity of application data being processed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td><strong>P2</strong></td>
            <td>A benchmark with strict rules that are required of systems processing sensitive data/workloads. This is meant to run on top of the minimum recommended baseline.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

INSERT CROSS-REFERENCE TO "BENCHMARKS" TOPIC

Pivotal P1 --> Pivotal 1 (P1) ?
Pivotal P2 --> Pivotal 2 (P2) ?

1. If you selected the **P1** or **P2** benchmarks above, some tests require additional system values.
   Configure the fields in the **System Variables** pane as follows:

    <table class="nice">
        <th>Field</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <tr><td><strong>Max audit log file size</strong></td>
                <td>The maximum log file size in MB.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td><strong>NTP Server</strong></td>
                <td>The IP address of your NTP server.<br>
                	The field takes in one server. (EDIT - Does it matter which one?)<br>
                	You can find this IP address in <strong>Bosh Director</strong> > <strong>Director Config</strong> > <strong>NTP Server</strong>.<br>
                </td>
        </tr>
		<tr><td><strong>Syslog host</strong></td>
                <td>The IP address of your syslog host. (EDIT - Where can I find this??)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Syslog port</strong></td>
                <td>The port number of the syslog port. (EDIT - Where can I find this??)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>




## <a id="errands"></a> Configure Errands
<%= vars.product_short %> performs one errand that initiates scanning.
This errand is enabled by default.
When this errand is triggered, it initiates the scanning errand on each VM.
If you do not want to scan every time changes are applied, then disable the errand.
(HOW? --> You can also uncheck the errand on the review pending changes screen.?)
When scanning is done, a second errand is triggered by the initial (EDIT Master?) errand to retrieve the logs from each VM.


## <a id="resources"></a> Configure Resources
The tile creates a new VM called oscap_store to store the logs retrieved from all the other VMs.
The resourcing of this VM can be configured here.

(EDIT? "Pivotal Recommends")
The VM doesnâ€™t do anything computationally extensive, thus smaller sizes are sufficient.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply changes** to install <%= vars.product_short %> tile.


## <a id="apply-changes"></a> Apply Changes from Your Configuration
Your installation is not complete until you apply your configuration changes.
Follow the steps below:

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. If you are using Ops Manager v2.3 (EDIT?) or later, click **Review Pending Changes**.
For more information about this Ops Manager page,
see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).

1. Click **Apply Changes** to complete the installation of <%= vars.product_short %>.
