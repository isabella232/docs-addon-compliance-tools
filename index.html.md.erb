<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>


<p class="note warning">
<strong>WARNING! </strong>
The <%= vars.product_full %> tile is currently in beta and is intended for evaluation and test purposes only. 
However, this product can be used in a PCF production environment, as it does not have any impact on other tiles or VMs.
</p>

The <%= vars.product_full %> (PCF) provides platform operators and auditors an assessment of each PCF component VM’s compliance posture against standard configuration guidelines.


## <a id='overview'></a>Overview
Bundled tests for existing commercial configuration scanners are tuned for traditional Ubuntu servers, thus, running such scans against a Stemcell would yield numerous false-positives.

The <%= vars.product_short %> address this issue by tuning industry recognized Ubuntu configuration benchmarks for Stemcells. It packages the OSCAP scanner, configuration tests written in YML called XFiles, and  XGen, a tool that translates XFiles tests to the SCAP format. Despite being an Add-on, it is installed through Ops Man and as a part of the installation, it will deploy each packaged component to each VM, as well as instantiating a new VM for log retrieval.

Scans are triggered through Ops Man, running as errands. Upon a successful scan, report retrieval is available through the tile and downloadable to an operator’s local machine.


## <a id='features'></a>Key Features
<%= vars.product_short %> includes the following key features:

* Modified version of industry recognized configuration benchmark tuned for Stemcells.
* Bundled tests written in YML, allowing for easier readability.
* Scan result report for each VM in the foundation,
highlighting the compliance posture.
