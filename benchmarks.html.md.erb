This topic describes how to install and configure <%= vars.product_full %>.

## <a id='overview'></a> Install and Configure <%= vars.product_short %>

When using <%= vars.product_short %>, one of the items used to configure scans are Benchmark profiles. 


(EDIT)
## <a id='benchmarks'></a> Benchmarks
This section is where you can specify which set of benchmarks to run and specify the expected value associated with various components for their corresponding tests.

1. Click **Scan Configuration**.

1. Configure the fields in the **Benchmarks** section as follows:

    <table class="nice">
        <th>Benchmark</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <tr><td><strong>STIG for Ubuntu Xenial</strong></td>
                <td>The full Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) STIG published by DISA with trivial Stemcell specific changes to tests. A trivial change is limited to updating the file path and/or regex. These changes do not compromise the integrity of the tests themselves. The failing tests from scanning this benchmark highlights the fundamental differences between a Stemcell and its standard Ubuntu counterpart. Auditors can further assess each one individually to gauge the security impact.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Base-Xenial</strong></td>
                <td>Is a subset of the full STIG where it only includes passing tests. This is meant to serve as a baseline for testing by highlighting the scan result of an unadulterated Stemcell against applicable tests.</td>
        </tr>
		<tr><td><strong>P1</strong></td>
                <td>This benchmark was developed inhouse and includes tests representative of the minimum recommended configuration baseline. All systems should implement, regardless of user environment or sensitivity of application data being processed.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td><strong>P2</strong></td>
                <td>Tests covered in this benchmark are reflective of the current best practices. The strict configuration being tested may not be required for low assurance applications.  However, they become requirements for systems processing sensitive data/workloads, even though they may potentially impact operator experience (i.e. requiring audit logging — takes time and space, but that’s a cost we accept for workloads that matter). </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

1. If you selected the **P1** or **P2** benchmarks above, some tests require additional system values.
   Configure the fields in the **Desired Test Values** section as follows:

    <table class="nice">
        <th>Field</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <tr><td><strong>Max audit log file size</strong></td>
                <td>The maximum log file size in MB.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td><strong>NTP Server</strong></td>
                <td>The IP address of your NTP server.<br>
                	The field takes in one server. (EDIT?)<br>
                	You can find this in <strong>Bosh Director</strong> > <strong>Director Config</strong> > <strong>NTP Server</strong>.<br>
                </td>
        </tr>
		<tr><td><strong>Syslog host</strong></td>
                <td>The IP address of your syslog host.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Syslog port</strong></td>
                <td>The port number of the syslog port.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
